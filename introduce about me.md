“Avatar: Fire and Ash” has earned $450 million globally after a week of release, including $119 million at the domestic box office and $331 million overseas.

On Tuesday, James Cameron’s third trip to Pandora has collected $16.5 million in North America and $34.3 million internationally. Those mid-week ticket sales represent a steady hold from opening weekend and bode well for the upcoming Christmas stretch, which marks one of the busiest times of year for moviegoing.

“Avatar: Fire and Ash” is aiming for $75 million to $80 million through the four-day holiday frame, which would be enough to retain the No. 1 spot in North America. That’s as three new films — A24’s Timothee Chalamet-led sports dramedy “Marty Supreme,” the Focus Features musical drama “Song Sung Blue” and Sony’s disaster comedy “Anaconda” — enter the theatrical mix. Those films aren’t opening until Christmas Eve, so their respective studios won’t be reporting grosses until Christmas Day on Thursday.

Meanwhile, Disney‘s animated sequel “Zootopia 2” is expected to remain a force through the Christmas holiday. So far, the family friendly juggernaut has earned $1.3 billion worldwide, including a staggering $993 million overseas. “Zootopia 2” long ago outpaced the original 2016 film in box office grosses and will soon become only the second animated film ever (“Inside Out 2” was the first) to surpass $1 billion internationally.

Ahead of Christmas, Disney unwrapped a gift in the form of a major box office milestone. Thanks to all-audience hits like “Zootopia 2” and “Lilo & Stitch,” the studio surpassed $6 billion in global ticket sales — including $2.3 billion domestically and $3.65 billion internationally — for the first time since COVID and fifth time in history.
